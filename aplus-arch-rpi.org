#+TITLE: Arch Linux for the Raspberry Pi A+

* Creating the SD Card[fn:source-sd-card: http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi on [2014-12-07 Sun]]
Replace <sdX> in the following instructions with the device name for the SD card
as it appears on your computer.

1. Start fdisk to partition the SD card:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ fdisk /dev/<sdX>
   #+END_SRC

2. At the fdisk prompt, delete old partitions and create a new one:
   a. Type =o=. This will clear out any partitions on the drive.
   b. Type =p= to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
   c. Type =n=, then =p= for primary, =1= for the first partition on the drive,
      press ENTER to accept the default first sector, then type =+100M= for the
      last sector.
Type t, then c to set the first partition to type W95 FAT32 (LBA).
Type n, then p for primary, 2 for the second partition on the drive, and then
press ENTER twice to accept the default first and last sector.
Write the partition table and exit by typing w.
Create and mount the FAT filesystem:
mkfs.vfat /dev/<sdX>1
mkdir boot
mount /dev/<sdX>1 boot
Create and mount the ext4 filesystem:
mkfs.ext4 /dev/<sdX>2
mkdir root
mount /dev/<sdX>2 root
Download and extract the root filesystem (as root, not via sudo):
wget http://archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz
bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz -C root
sync
Move boot files to the first partition:
mv root/boot/* boot
Unmount the two partitions:
umount boot root
Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect ethernet, and apply 5V power.
Use the serial console or SSH to the IP address given to the board by your
router. The default root password is 'root'.
